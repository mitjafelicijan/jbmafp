# Just Build Me A Fucking Page

I am just so sick of all these complicated static site generators forcing you to
care about taxonomies and shit like this. All I want is to have a bunch of
markdown files and let them use specific templates. That is about it. Nothing
fancy!

This generator is not for people who need something more complicated. Use Hugo
instead. But if you need a simple blog page that needs to spit out an RSS feed
or two and have the option to define different templates for different posts,
well then this might be useful to you.
